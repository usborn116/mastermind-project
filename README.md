Play a game where you either create a 4-digit code for the computer to guess, or you try to guess the computer's 4 digit code! If you're the code creator, you'll pick a code and watch as the computer tries several guesses. If you're the guesser, you will be able to enter a guess each time and get feedback on how close youre guess was. The guesser has 12 tries to get it right.

Run this by cloning the repo, navigating to the repo in your Terminal, and using the command ruby display.rb!
